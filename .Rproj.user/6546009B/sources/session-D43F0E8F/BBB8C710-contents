## Overview

- This application was made in R using the Shiny package.
- It takes 7 different variables and fits two linear models to predict the gas mileage in the city and in highways.
- There are two types of inputs: a slider and six drop down menus.
- server.R includes the backend calculation of the web app.
- ui.R includes the code needed to render the UI elements in HTML.

The data used was the "mpg" library from the "ggplot2" package:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
head(mpg)
```



## Parts of the Application

Side Panel
